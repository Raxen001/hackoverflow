Problem Statement 2 (E-books Sharing Platform):
Develop a platform for users to share and exchange e-books securely.
Implement encrypted file storage, secure user authentication, and measures to prevent unauthorized distribution of COPYRIGHTED material. Implement measures to prevent the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material. This includes content identification algorithms, watermarking, or other techniques to trace and deter the sharing of copyrighted e-books without proper authorization. Implement algorithms that can recognize identical content and ensure that users cannot submit the same e-book multiple times. Provide users with granular privacy controls over their shared content. Users should be able to specify who can access their e-books and set restrictions on sharing to ensure the privacy of their personal libraries. Implement a system for community moderation where users can report any suspected copyright infringements or inappropriate content. Develop mechanisms for timely review and appropriate action on reported issues. Include audit trails and logging mechanisms to track user activities and interactions with e-books. This ensures transparency and aids in identifying any potential security breaches or misuse of the platform.
